            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>We are just as it sounds, a grill restaurant owned by the founder of the salty kitchen, a butcher with over 7 years of experience.  
               Lil John as he is called is also one of the founders of toxic valley, where you will find both BBQKING and Salty kitchen.

              BBQKING's menu consists mainly of meat, everything from noble pieces such as beef fillet, wagyu steak and T-Bonesteak. We put alot of love into our food, which reflects the constant increase in guests.
              For us, quality means everything and thanks to our  shop, we can use the best meat details in all our cooking!</p>
