                <p>Aged steak typically tastes decidedly beefy, much like a rare roast beef, while also taking on subtler hints of other delicious flavours, such as warm buttered popcorn. It can also taste somewhat nutty, and can sometimes veer into the cheesy category.</p>
                <h3>
                  <span>Tomahawk steak</span>
                  <span>40$</span>
                  <span>120$</span>
                </h3>
                <p>If you are looking for a chunk of beef that looks and feels like you could go out and hunt more beef with it, the Tomahawk Steak is the cut for you. It's an impressive steak that's great for dropping jaws.</p>
                <h3>
                  <span>Wagyu steak</span>
                  <span>120$</span>

                </h3>
                <p>The succulent umami meat juices and fat then come through, giving an almost silky sensation that practically melts in the mouth. A delicate buttery taste then starts to become apparent, rounding off with a beautiful sweetness.</p>
